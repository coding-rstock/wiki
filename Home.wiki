# Richard's Coding Wiki

This wiki summarizes all of the key concepts I've learned right from day one as I pursue my goal of becoming a full time developer.  It begins with the most basic 'ground-level' foundations, and builds upon them. It is the primary location for all important and useful information I learn on a daily basis.  It's intended to be as minimalist as possible, relying on high quality source material for academia, while still providing a fairly complete coverage of the concepts from a pragmatic user's perspective.

I welcome and appreciate any and all critical feedback to improve this wiki, and hope it becomes a useful tool for many who aspire to learn how to code!
