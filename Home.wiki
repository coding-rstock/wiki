# Richard's Coding Wiki

This wiki is where I store literally all of the info and resouces I've obtained right from day one as I pursue my goal of becoming a full time developer.  It begins with the most basic 'ground-level' foundations, and builds upon them. 

It's written by a beginner, for other beginners.  In terms of content, it's as minimalist as possible, relying on high quality material that's already available online.  In terms of scope, it's as comprehensive as necessary to provide a full and complete coverage of what is important from a pragmatic perspective.

I welcome and appreciate any and all critical feedback to improve this wiki, and hope it becomes a useful tool for many who aspire to learn how to code!
