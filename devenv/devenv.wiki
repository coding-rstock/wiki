# Creating Your Development Environment

A **[development environment]()** comprises a **"workstation" (computer optimized for development)**, and a**"workspace" (office)**. Creating this environment is mandatory before beginning to code, just as a carpenter needs to set up their shop, workbench, and tools before building a table or chair.

### Making this a first priority

It's best to create this environment before diving into the actual learning how to code.  There are a lot of things to do and configure before actually opening an editor to code.   Without a proper environment your work flow will be very inefficient and cause frustration later.  As a beginner looking to start formal training/education in learning to code,  it is extremely challenging to "learn a new language", "how to use a certain software", or "how to problem solve" if the development environment feels foreign to them.   Setting up and becoming somewhat comfortable in this environment 2-4 weeks in advance of starting formal training would be ideal.

Every developer will have different preferences and work styles, and the goal is to create an environment that maximizes productivity and efficiency while maintaining long term physical and emotional health.  A setup might be productive while causing eye or wrist or back pain isn't sustainable.  Or a setup might not have those issues, but the tools aren't
