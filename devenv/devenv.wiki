# Creating Your Development Environment

A development environment is comprised of:

[Developer Workstation](/devenv/station):  includes your computer, operating system, and the set of developer tools (software) that you need to optimize your productivity and efficiency.  

[Developer Workspace](/devenv/space):  includes your office, your desk, chair, audio, screens, mouse, accessories, etc.

Creating this environment is mandatory before beginning to code, just as a carpenter needs to set up their shop, workbench, and tools before building a table or chair.

It's best to create this environment before diving into the actual learning how to code.  Without a proper environment your work flow will be very inefficient and cause frustration later.  As a beginner it is extremely challenging to "learn a new language", "how to use a certain software", or "how to problem solve" if the development environment feels foreign to them.   Setting up and becoming somewhat comfortable in this environment 2-4 weeks in advance of starting formal training would be ideal.

Every developer will have different preferences and work styles, and the goal is to create an environment that is custom made for you that maximizes productivity and efficiency while maintaining long term physical and emotional health.  A setup that is productive while causing eye or wrist or back pain isn't productive long term.  On the other hand, a setup might be sustainable yet not efficient, and result in hundreds of hours wasted over one's career.
