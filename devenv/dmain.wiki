# Creating Your Development Environment

Creating and customizing your development environment to suit *your workstyle* is mandatory before beginning to code, just as a carpenter needs to set up their shop, workbench, and tools before building a table or chair.

Without a proper environment your work flow will be inevitably cause frustration later, so there's no point in delaying setting it up prior to beginning to coding.  As a beginner it is extremely challenging to "learn a new language", "how to use a certain software", or "how to problem solve" if the development environment feels foreign.

Below are all the components that collectively form the development environment, with links to further detail and resources on each.
