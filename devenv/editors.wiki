# Editors
---

Editors are the tools developers use to write and compile their code.  They range from simple text editors (ie notepad) to complex integrated development environments (known as "IDE").  They can be completely terminal based (Vim, Emacs) or fully GUI based (VS Code).

There is a time and a place for using different editors given different circumstances and types of projects, however typically it's best practice to get very familiar with one or two editors and learn how to use them very well, instead of "hopping" around trying different editors.
