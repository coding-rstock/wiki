# Arch Install Guide for Beginners

This guide is intended to supplement the [Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide), because a person brand new to Linux is going to have difficulty following it.  To use this guide:  

1. You will need a laptop with both this guide and the Arch Wiki ("AW") guide open side by side in 2 windows.
2. Use the 'AW Guide' as the main guide, and keep checking this guide as you go along, to see if there's a "Suggested Action" (see far left column in the table below) for any of the sections of the AW guide.
3. Be mentally prepared and pay extreme attention to detail, because if you miss a step, it could mean having to restart.  Everything is important.
