# Arch Install Guide for Beginners

This guide is intended to supplement the [Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide), as it isn't straightforward enough for a person brand new to Linux to follow.   You will need a laptop with both this guide and the Arch Wiki ("AW") guide open side by side in 2 windows.  

Each step in this guide references a section of the AW guide.  The best way to follow this guide is to use the AW Guide as the main guide, and keep checking this guide as you go along, to see if there's a "Suggested Action" for any of the sections of the AW guide.

Be prepared and pay extreme attention to detail, because if you miss a step, it could mean having to restart.  Everything is important.
