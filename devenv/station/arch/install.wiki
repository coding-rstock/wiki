# Arch Install Guide for Beginners

This guide is intended to supplement the [Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide), as it isn't straightforward enough for a person brand new to Linux to follow.   You will need a laptop with both this guide and the Arch Install guide open side by side in 2 windows.  Be prepared and pay extreme attention to detail, because if you miss a step, it could mean having to restart.
